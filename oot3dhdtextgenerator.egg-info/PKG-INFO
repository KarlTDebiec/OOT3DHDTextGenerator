## Description

This package generates high resolution text for The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time 3D,
to be used with the [Citra 3DS emulator](https://citra-emu.org). Citra includes support
for replacing low resolution textures with high resolution alternatives. In most games,
this functionality makes it straightforward to obtain high resolution text by replacing
a small number of font textures. However, Ocarina of Time has an unusual text
implementation in which every time a text string is displayed the game generates an
image including one instance of each unique character in the string. The script works
around this behavior by:

1. Loading text image from the directory to which Citra saves textures
2. Parsing each text image into its component characters
3. Writing new high resolution text images to the load directory from which Citra loads
   replacement textures

The package scans for text images as the game is played. The first time a text string is
displayed it will be low resolution, but the next time that same string is reloaded for
display it will be replaced with a high resolution version. Playing through the complete
game should therefore yield a set of high resolution text images that cover most
displayed text.

<div align="center" style="text-align:center">

    <h3>Original Text</h3>
    <br>

    <h3>High-Resolution Text</h3>
</div>

**Unfortunately**, the North American, European, and Japanese localizations have a
behaviour that sharply limits the usefulness of this script: they do not fully clear the
text image between uses. If string A with 15 unique characters is displayed, followed by
string B with 20 unique characters, and then string A again, two unique text images will
be generated for string A. The first will include string A's 15 unique characters, and
the second will include string A's 15 unique characters followed by string B's 16th
through 20th characters. Thus, the text image of a string depends on the contents of the
strings viewed previously, vastly increasing the number of potential text images. This
is difficult to work around without modifying either the internals of the game or Citra,
and limits the usefulness of the package for these localizations. It is still fully
functional, but in practice a relatively small portion of displayed text will be high
resolution.

**Fortunately**, the Chinese localization, for which this package was originally
designed to be used, clears the text image between usages, making it viable to generate
a high resolution text package for this language. A simplified Chinese high resolution
text package covering most of the game text has been created and is available on the
[releases page](https://github.com/KarlTDebiec/OOT3DHDTextGenerator/releases/).
